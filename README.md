Fupixel
=======

Code-centric pixel framework for Unity.

Want to make games in Unity with using SetPixel() and GetPixel() only? Now you can.

Fupixel handles the Unity setup. All you need to do is start poking those pixels from code :)

Quickstart:
1. Create a new scene
2. Add empty GameObject
3. Drag Fupixel script to the new GameObject
4. Drag Examples/SinglePixel.cs to the new GameObject
5. Press play

Examine the examples for more information.
