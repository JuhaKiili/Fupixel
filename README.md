Fupixel
=======

Code-centric pixel framework for Unity.

Want to make games in Unity with using SetPixel() and GetPixel() only? Now you can.

Fupixel handles the Unity setup. All you need to do is start poking those pixels from code :)

Quickstart:

1. Create a new scene
2. Add empty GameObject
3. Drag Fupixel script to the new GameObject
4. Drag Examples/SinglePixel.cs to the new GameObject
5. Press play

You can setup your resolution from the Fupixel-component inspector. It's probably a good idea to set your player resolution to match it. For example 160x120 for Fupixel and 640x480 for Unity player gives you nice 4x pixels.

Examine the source code and examples for more information.
